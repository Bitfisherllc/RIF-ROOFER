# Vercel Deployment Status

## What Happened

✅ Vercel automatically detected your new push to GitHub
✅ A new Production Deployment was created automatically
✅ The old deployment cannot be redeployed (this is normal)

## Next Steps

1. **Go to your Vercel Dashboard:**
   - https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Find your "RIF-ROOFER" project

2. **Check the Latest Deployment:**
   - Look for the most recent deployment (should be at the top)
   - Check if it shows:
     - ✅ "Ready" (green) = Success!
     - ⏳ "Building" = Still in progress
     - ❌ "Error" = Check the build logs

3. **If Deployment Succeeded:**
   - Your site is live!
   - Click on the deployment to see the live URL
   - Usually: `https://rif-roofer.vercel.app` or similar

4. **If Deployment Failed:**
   - Click on the failed deployment
   - Check the "Build Logs" tab
   - Share the error message with me

## Build Fixes Applied

✅ Fixed `/api/auth/me` route (added dynamic export)
✅ Fixed `/login` page (added Suspense boundary)
✅ Fixed `/password-verify` page (added Suspense boundary)
✅ Build completes successfully locally

The new deployment should succeed! 🚀
