## 📝 Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

   - Or click the "+" icon in the top right → "New repository"

2. **Repository Settings:**
   - **Repository name:** `RIF`
   - **Description:** (Optional) "Florida Roofers website - Stone-coated metal roofing directory"
   - **Visibility:** Choose Public or Private
   - **⚠️ IMPORTANT:** 
     - ❌ DO NOT check "Initialize this repository with a README"
     - ❌ DO NOT check "Add .gitignore"
     - ❌ DO NOT check "Choose a license"
   - Leave everything unchecked/empty

3. **Click "Create repository"**

4. **After creating, GitHub will show you commands - DON'T RUN THEM YET!**

## 📝 Step 2: Connect and Push

After you've created the repository on GitHub, I'll give you the commands to push your code.

**Just reply "repo created" when you've created the GitHub repository and I'll provide the push commands!**

**Alternative:** If you want me to help you create it via GitHub CLI, let me know and we can try that approach.
