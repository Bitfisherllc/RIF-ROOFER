PASSWORD FIELD IS INVISIBLE - THIS IS NORMAL!

When you type your GitHub token, NOTHING will show on screen (no dots, no stars). This is for security.

SOLUTION:
1. Just TYPE your token (ghp_xxxxx) - even though you can't see it
2. Press ENTER
3. It should work!

If it still doesn't work, try this first:
git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain

Then try pushing again.
