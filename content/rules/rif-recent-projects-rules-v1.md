# RIF Recent Projects — Writing & SEO Rules (v1)

Use this ruleset for every **"Recently Completed"** project post.

## How to invoke

Start your request with: **Use RIF Recent Projects Rules (v1)**. Then paste the project URL (or brand/profile/color + city). I'll apply these rules automatically.

## Output order (always)

1. Focus keyphrase
2. SEO title
3. Slug
4. Meta description (~155 chars)
5. Social title
6. Social description
7. Content (with H1 rendered, plus H2/H3 as needed)

## H1 / Title

* The **first H1 must be a short sentence** that includes the word **"Roofer"**, the **town/city**, and the **roof style** (brand/profile).
* Render it as an **actual H1** at the top of section 7 (no label).
* Keep it concise and front‑load important words.

**Examples:**

* Roofer in Naples, Florida — New QueenTile Verona Roof
* Englewood Roofer — New Tilcor Antica (Pisa) Roof
* Roofer in Punta Gorda, Florida — New McElroy Met‑Tile Roof

## Style & readability (Yoast‑aligned)

* **Active voice**; avoid passive.
* **Short sentences**: aim for avg ≤ 20 words; no more than ~25% over 20 words; one idea per sentence; use transition words.
* **Transition words** throughout: Then, Next, Because, Therefore, As a result, Moreover, However, Meanwhile, Finally.
* Vary sentence length for flow; replace long clause chains with two shorter sentences.

## Heading rules (Yoast‑aligned)

* **One H1 per page.** Use **H2** for main sections and **H3** for subsections—don't skip levels.
* Put a heading above each thematic unit; aim around **250–350 words** under a subheading before the next one.
* Make headings **descriptive** (not vague).
* Use the **focus keyphrase** in **some** H2/H3 subheads (≈30–75%), not all—avoid stuffing.
* Use headings for structure, not styling.

## SEO targeting

* Keep the focus on people searching for a **roofer in {City, Florida}**.
* **Keyphrase in introduction:** include the exact **focus keyphrase** in the first paragraph (preferably first 1–2 sentences).
* **Keyphrase length:** prefer **2–4 words** (e.g., *Florida roofer in Naples*). Avoid awkwardly long phrases.
* **Keyphrase density:** keep a natural spread; aim roughly **0.5%–1.5%**. Use synonyms as needed.
* **Keyphrase distribution:** mention early, repeat a few times across the body, and include in **some** subheads to reinforce.
* **Page/SEO titles:** place the keyphrase **near the front**; keep total length ~55–60 characters when possible.
* **Meta description length:** aim for **~155 characters** (target 150–160). Use active voice, include the city and a clear benefit (in‑stock materials, certified crews, distributor pricing).

## Linking (internal & outbound)

* **Internal linking (best practice):** link to relevant service pages (stone‑coated metal), city pages, and related projects with descriptive anchors.
* **Outbound links (best practice):** when citing standards or brands, link to authoritative sources.
* **Your directive:** **do not output links** in deliverables. These rules guide your CMS linking only.

## Content requirements for each post

* **Several short paragraphs** (not one big block).
* Always add a **Distributor Pricing** paragraph: RIF is the installation division of **Premium Roofing Products (PRP Roofing)**; we provide **installer‑direct, distributor‑level pricing**; we stage materials from our **Florida warehouse**; jobs start on time.
* Always add a **Local Town** paragraph with city context (coastal/inland, storms, HOAs, common roof styles, seasonal weather).
* Mention **in‑stock materials**, **certified installer network**, and **RIF manages everything** (financing, product selection, permits/HOA, delivery, installation, final QA).
* Include a **Specs (quick glance)** list (brand, profile, color, assembly highlights).
* **No links** in outputs.

## Slug rules

* Kebab case; include city; include brand/profile where relevant.
* Example: `projects/florida-roofer-naples-new-queentile-verona`.
